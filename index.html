There are 1939864 of them. Group theoretical computations were performed using <a href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/">Magma</a>, while reduction modulo graph isomorphism and other graph manipulations were done with the help of <a href="https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it">Nauty</a> (version 2_8_8).

            Using a mixed bag of different techniques, a complete list of all connected 4-valent Cayley graphs, currently up to order 1025, as well as those with 1536 vertices. The following zipped file contains the list of graphs in <a href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html">sparse6</a> format:

            Unzipping the first archive produces a folder containing one file for each order from 5 to 1025. The second archive contains all graphs on 1536 vertices in a single file. This is work in progress and the census will be expanded in the following weeks with more information about the graphs and how they were generated.

          <p>
            A Cayley graph Cay(G,S) is <strong>minimal</strong> if S defines an inclusion-minimal generating set of G. Using an orderly generation algorithm, a complete list of all minimal Cayley graphs on up to 511 vertices was determined. There are 33645009 of them. Group theoretical computations were performed using <a href="https://www.gap-system.org">GAP</a>, while reduction modulo graph isomorphism and other graph manipulations were done with the help of <a href="https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it">Nauty</a> (version 2_8_8).

          <summary>Census of cubic edge-transitive graphs on up to 10000 vertices (P. Potočnik and Marston Conder)

          <p>
            This census contains all cubic edge-transitive graphs on at most 10000 vertices (both, arc-transitive, as well as semisymmetric). The database of arc-transitive graphs extends the well-known Foster census. The extension to 10000 vertices was computed in 2011 by Marston Conder, and the semisymmetric case was done by Conder and Potočnik in 2012.

          <p>
            Based on some theoretical work of Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself, we were able to construct a complete list of all tetravalent arc-transitive graphs on at most 640 vertices. The magma code which generates the sequence of these graphs can be found <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/work_datoteke/Census4val-640.mgm">here</a>. If you use this list for research purposes, please cite the following papers: <i>P. Potočnik, P. Spiga, G.

Verret, Cubic vertex-transitive graphs on up to 1280 vertices, J. Symbolic. Comp. 50 (2013) 465-477</i>. We would also like to thank Marston Conder who provided the list of all regular maps with at most 640 edges, which were needed to compile this census.

          <summary>Census of edge-transitive tetravalent graphs on up to 512 vertices (joint work with Steve Wilson)
          </summary>
          <p>I am currently involved in an ambitious project, suggested by <a href="https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~swilson/C4FullSite/index.html">Steve Wilson</a> of <a href="http://nau.edu/">Northern Arizona University</a>, whose aim is to compile a complete list (census) of all edge-transitive tetravalent graphs on at most 512 vertices. The current (uncomplete) version of the census can be found <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~swilson/C4FullSite/index.html">here</a>. There are several segments, though, in which the current version is complete. For example, it contains all 2-arc-transitive graphs up to that order, as well as all arc-transitive and half-arc-transitive graphs (due to the joint work with G. Verret and P. Spiga mentioned above). The census is, however, incomplete for the case of semisymmetric graphs. Some of the semisymmetric graphs from the table are available in magma code <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/TetraSS2016/TetraSS2016.zip">here</a> (after unzipping the downloaded file, copy the *.mgm and *.txt file to the magma work directory and load the *.mgm file into magma - a double sequence TetraSS will be created with TetraSS[n,k] being the k-th graph on n vertices).

Wilson, <a href="https://adam-journal.eu/index.php/ADAM/article/view/1269">Recipes for edge transitive tetravalent graphs</a>, Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics</i>.

The current <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/work_datoteke/AT5-Census.mgm">list</a> (in magma code) contains all those pentavalent arc-transitive graphs on up to 500 vertices which admit an arc-transitive group G with the vertex stabiliser G_v acting faithfully on the neighbourhood of v and being solvable (i.e. G_v is one of C_5, D_5, or Aff(1,5)). Beware, this is work in progress — codenames of the graphs might change in the future.

As a byproduct, we've computed all connected 4-valent graphs with at most 1.000 vertices that admit a half-arc-transitive action of a group of automorphisms. In particular, all tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs are there. The graphs are available in magma format (note that the graphs might fail to load into some older versions of magma, or magma for Windows).

          <summary>Census of rotary maps (joint work with Pablo Spiga and Gabriel Verret)</summary>
          <p>
            Based on the census of (2,*)-groups (see below), a census of all rotary maps was constructed. Recall that a rotary map is either chiral (in which case its group of automorphisms acts regularly on the oriented edges of the graph but contains no orientation reversing automorphism), or regular (in which case the automorphism group acts regularly on the flags of the map), the latter either orientable or non-orientable. The census is complete up to 1500 edges in the case of non-orientable maps, and up to 3000 edges for orientable maps (both chiral and regular). The previously known <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/">census of Marston Conder</a> contained the maps up to 1000 edges. A census of the underlying skeleton graphs of these maps was also computed. For more information and instruction how to use the census, please read the <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMaps/Census-RotaryMaps-README.txt">README file</a>. The following files are available for download (note that some of these files are rather large - largest is 34MB long):

          <summary>Census of rotary maps by genus and by the number of edges - extended (joint work with Marston Conder)</summary>
          <p> During a workshop on Symmetries of discrete structures in Kranjska Gora in 2022, Marston Conder suggested that it would be worth extending his <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/">census</a> of rotary maps of small genus (that went up to genus 301). To do that, an extension of the census of rotary maps on up to 1500/3000 edges in the non-orientable/orientable case (constructed by Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself in 2014) would be useful. Using the same mathematical ideas, but improving and optimising some of the algorithms, we obtained a complete list of rotary maps (both chiral as well as reflexible) on <strong> up to 6000 edges in the orientable case</strong>, and <strong>up to 3000 edges in the non-orientable case</strong>. With some extra work (dealing with the maps of some particular valencies and face-lengths), we obtained all rotary maps on surfaces of <strong>genus up to 1501 in the orientable case</strong> and up to <strong>1502 in the non-orientable case</strong>. A list of all skeletons (underlying graps) of all rotary maps with up to 3000 edges was also extracted from there.
          </p>

          <summary>Census of (2,*)-groups (joint work with Pablo Spiga and Gabriel Verret)</summary>
          <p>
            A (2,*)-generated group is a group that can be generated by an involution and one extra element. A magma file containing all (2,*)-groups of order at most 6000 is available for download <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/TwoStarGroups/TwoStarGroups.mgm">here</a>. This mgm file requires also this <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/TwoStarGroups/TwoStarGroups6k.txt.zip">txt file</a> (zipped). Moreover, the mgm file contains a function that will generate all the corresponding generating pairs of the (2,*)-groups (modulo the action of the automorphism group of the group). This function will need the following, rather lengthy <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/TwoStarGroups/TwoStarPairs6k.txt.zip">file</a> (about 585Mb zipped). To read more about this, click <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/TwoStarGroups/TwoStarGroups-README.txt">here</a>. This work makes part of a larger project (by Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself) of constructing complete lists of 4-valent half-arc-transitive graphs and cubic vertex-transitive graphs (see below).
